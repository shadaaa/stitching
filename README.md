# Image Stitching
This repository contains code for stitching multiple images together to create a panoramic image using computer vision techniques.

# Overview
Image stitching is a process of combining multiple images with overlapping fields of view to produce a seamless panoramic image. This technique finds applications in various fields such as photography, virtual reality, and satellite imaging.

# Features
Feature Detection and Matching: Detect common features in overlapping images and match them to find corresponding points.
Homography Estimation: Compute the transformation matrix (homography) that maps points from one image to another.
Image Warping: Warp or transform images based on the computed homography to align them properly.
Blending: Blend the overlapping regions of the images to create a smooth transition between them.
